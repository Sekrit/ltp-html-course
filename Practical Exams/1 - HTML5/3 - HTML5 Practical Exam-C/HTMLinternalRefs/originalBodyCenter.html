            <h2 style="text-align: center;">A little about me...</h2>
            <br>
    
            <p>Some people (to this day, I have no idea why), want to know what it is to be me... to live me life.</p>

            <p>It is humbling, though it gives me enough of a chuckle to entertain the possiblity that instead of denying such requests, laughing them away, or likely even seeming self-deprecating at times, perhaps I should just place into out into the ether of the internets.</p>

            <p>And, with good fortune, they, the masses, shall be sated.</p>

            <p>I enjoy finding opportunities to learn, and execute what I learn, as much as possible.  The problem these days, seems to be that I have so much opportunity, that I allow myself to spin in too many directions to be practical.</p>

            <p>But, I say: "Screw it!"  I have done enough in my life to allow myself to bask in the glory of what may well be a "mid-life-crisis". </p>

            <p>I mean, I do not have a wife who I am in the process of betraying.  I have no children who need me to bail them out of jail, pay their tuitions, or anything.  And, since there are not notable negative consequences... Then I will do my best to learn as much as possible about the subjects of my interest.</p>

            <p>Ok 2018...
