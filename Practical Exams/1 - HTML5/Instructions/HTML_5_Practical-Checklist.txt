Welcome to your HTML 5 Practical!

I want you to make a webpage to tell me about your favorite hobby (hopefully something that’s not web development, 
I have enough of that in my life) according to the following guidelines:



HEAD/Layout
- Use Foundation to put all of your content in the middle 50% of a desktop screen and 100% of a mobile device screen
(Foundation not used during HTML5 Mobile course... Not familiar/comfortable with it, subbing jQuery)



MENU BAR
- Make a basic menu bar with internal links titled “HEADER”, “CONTENT”, “REFERENCES”, and “FORM”
- Have those links point to the respective parts of the page outlined below 


HEADER
- Make a heading that says “{Your First Name} Explains {Hobby}”



CONTENT
- Write a couple paragraphs about how you discovered this hobby, how you get started with it, 
and what you’ve been doing with it lately

- Include either a picture or embedded video telling more about your hobby



REFERENCES
- Provide an ordered list of external links to your top three resources for reading about or researching your hobby

- Prepare a table with columns titled “Phrase” and “Meaning” and populate it with a few bits of lingo from your hobby,
 and their definitions



SIGN UP FORM
- Make a form (doesn’t have to actually function) to allow readers to sign up for your imaginary newsletter
- Ask them for their first name, last name, email address, zip code, and date of birth
- Have a non functional “Submit” button

Whenever you’ve met the above requirements, push your project up to GitHub and send me a link to the repository on Slack 
so that I can review your work. Best of luck!
