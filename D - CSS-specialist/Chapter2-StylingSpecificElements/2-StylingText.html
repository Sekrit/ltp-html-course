    <p>The Raven</p>
    <p>Edgar Allan Poe</p>
    <p class="poem">
        Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
        Over a many quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore--
            
        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
        As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
           
        " 'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "Tapping at my chamber door--
        Only this and nothing more."
