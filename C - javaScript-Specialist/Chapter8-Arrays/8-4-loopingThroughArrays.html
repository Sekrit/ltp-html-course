/* The Below script was initially written outside of the "window.onload" function, as it was not really easy to see what was going on in the video screen regarding script nesting.  After failed testing, I decided to go back and move the script inside of the "window.onload", as I assumed that the "Cars" array displayed properly, and figured that the scope of the "for" function should be moved to where the "while" function was.
